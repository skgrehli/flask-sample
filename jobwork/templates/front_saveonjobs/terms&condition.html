				<p><strong>2.1</strong> The SaveonJobs Service will be reviewed and updated from time to time. In addition to the points set out below, certain portion(s) of the SaveonJobs Service may be separately described on the SaveonJobs Platform.</p>
                <p><strong>2.2</strong> A SaveonJobs Hirer with a requirement for a service to be provided or a good to be acquired (1) creates an account with SaveonJobs and (2) posts an accurate and complete description of the good to be acquired or service to be provided (including, but not limited to, the payment offered to the SaveonJobs Jobber) ("Posted Job"). Posted Jobs are subject to further terms set out for Posting Jobs and Making Offers below.</p>
                <p><strong>2.3</strong> A SaveonJobs Jobber with an ability to perform services and/or to provide the goods (1) creates an account with SaveonJobs and (2) reviews Posted Jobs uploaded by SaveonJobs Hirers.</p>
                <p><strong>2.4</strong> If SaveonJobs Jobber desires to provide services or sell goods to a SaveonJobs Hirer, the SaveonJobs Jobber must make an offer in response to the Posted Job ("Offer"). By making an Offer the Jobber confirms that s/he is legally entitled to and capable of supplying the goods or services described in the Posted Job. Offers are subject to further terms set out for Posting Jobs and Making Offers below.</p>
                <p><strong> 2.5</strong> If a SaveonJobs Hirer in any way updates a Posted Job after it has been published on the SaveonJobs Platform and before an offer has been accepted, then SaveonJobs may, at its discretion, cancel all Offers for that Posted Job that were made prior to the update and recommence the offer process. </p>
                <p> <strong>2.6</strong> If the SaveonJobs Hirer agrees to a SaveonJobs Jobber's offer, the SaveonJobs Hirer will accept that SaveonJobs Jobber's Offer by using the functionality on the SaveonJobs Platform and paying the agreed price into the payment facility escrow account accessible via the SaveonJobs Platform ("Escrow Account"). </p>

Once a SaveonJobs Hirer has accepted an offer from a SaveonJobs Jobber, the SaveonJobs Hirer and the SaveonJobs Jobber can communicate privately using a SaveonJobs private messaging service. Each time a User receives a message from the SaveonJobs messaging service, a notification may be sent to the User via their currently active communication channel.</p>
                <p><strong>2.8 </strong>Once a SaveonJobs Hirer has accepted an offer from a SaveonJobs Jobber and paid the agreed price into the Escrow Account then the SaveonJobs Hirer and the SaveonJobs Jobber will be deemed to have entered into a separate contract under which the SaveonJobs Hirer agrees to purchase, and the Buyer agrees to provide the SaveonJobs Hirer with the services or goods ("Job Contract").</p>
                
                <p> <strong>2.9</strong> The terms of the Job Contract incorporate the terms of this Agreement (to the extent they apply to the SaveonJobs Hirer and the SaveonJobs Jobber) and any additional terms and conditions agreed between the SaveonJobs Hirer and the SaveonJobs Jobber, including the description and price of the services or goods to be provided.

                <p><strong>2.10</strong> The SaveonJobs Jobber must provide the services or goods to the SaveonJobs Hirer in accordance with the Job Contract, unless the services, goods or transaction is prohibited by law, by this Agreement, an agreement between the User and a Third Party Provider or by any of our Policies.</p>

It will be material breach of this Agreement and the Job Contract if a Jobber provides notice that a job is complete for a particular Posted Job without having provided the relevant goods or services. If s/he is supplying goods, aJobber must not provide notice that a job is complete until the goods have actually been delivered to the address specified by the Hirer.</p>

                <p> <strong>2.12</strong> Once a SaveonJobs Jobber has provided the relevant goods or services in accordance with the Job Contract and has provided notice that the job is complete relating to a particular Posted Job, the SaveonJobs Hirer must release the agreed price for the goods or services supplied to the Jobber by using the SaveonJobs Platform functionality. It will be material breach of this Agreement and the Job Contract if, after a Jobber has provided the relevant goods or services in accordance with the Job Contract and provided notice that a job is complete for a particular Posted Job, the SaveonJobs Hirer fails to release the agreed price. </p>

                <p><strong>2.16</strong> SaveonJobs may from time to time include on the SaveonJobs Platform a "Hire Me" feature which enables SaveonJobs Users who are browsing other User profiles to post a request for goods and services based on the skills, reputation or other profile attributes of a particular User. When this occurs, the SaveonJobs User who the Hirer would like to make an Offer will be automatically notified (i) of the new Posted Job, and (ii) that the Hirer would like him/ her to make an Offer to supply the goods or services. However, that User will not have any further special rights and will need to follow the normal offer process to become theJobber for the Posted Job.</p>

For the purposes of these Terms, when a Business Partner is engaged in this way, the Business Partner will be a Hirer and the job will be a Posted Job for the purposes of these Terms. Jobbers who agree to perform Posted Jobs for Business Partners acknowledge and agree that SaveonJobs and the Business Partner may on sell the goods or services supplied to third parties for an increased fee.</p>

				<h2>10. FEES</h2>
				<p><strong>10.1</strong> Registering and creating and account with SaveonJobs is free. There is no charge for a  Hirer to Post Jobs, or for other SaveonJobs Users to review content on the SaveonJobs Platform, including Posted Jobs.</p>
                <p><strong>10.2</strong> If aHirer has accepted your offer, You agree that the Service Fees as set out in the Service Fee Schedule will be deducted from the agreed fee and paid to SaveonJobs (or its nominee), which are inclusive of GST.</p>
                <p><strong>10.3</strong> The Service Fees will be deducted and paid to SaveonJobs when the agreed price is released from the Escrow Account to the Jobber.</p>
                <p><strong>10.4</strong> To be clear, Service Fees will be calculated only on the amount that theJobber agrees to charge the Hirer to provide the service or goods. This means that if a Hirer requires a Jobber to incur costs in completing a job (for example, if the job is purchasing groceries, Jobber might agree to pay for the groceries upfront and then be reimbursed by the Hirer), then the cost incurred will not be included in any calculation of the Service Fees.</p>
                <p><strong>10.5</strong> If a Jobber agrees to pay some of the costs as part of completing a job, Jobber is solely responsible for having those costs reimbursed by the Hirer. SaveonJobs will not be responsible for obtaining any reimbursement from a Hirer. We adviseJobbers not to agree to incur any costs for a Hirer in advance of payment by the Hirer, unless theJobber is confident that the Hirer will reimburse the costs promptly.</p>
                <p><strong>10.6</strong> SaveonJobs may from time to time change the Service Fees and the terms applying to their payment. Any change relating to the Service Fees is effective fourteen (14) days after SaveonJobs notifies You of that change by sending a message to your SaveonJobs account.</p>
                <p><strong>10.7</strong> SaveonJobs may choose to temporarily modify the Service Fees, or the terms applying to their payment, in its sole discretion. Notification of temporary modifications will also be sent to your SaveonJobs account.</p>
                <p><strong>10.8</strong> All fees and charges payable to SaveonJobs are non-cancellable and non-refundable, subject to your rights under any Non-Excludable Conditions (defined below).</p>
                <p><strong>10.9</strong> If SaveonJobs introduces a new service on the SaveonJobs Platform, the fees applying to that service will be payable as from the launch of the service and will also be "Service Fees" under this Agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>10.10</strong> Where aJobber is supplying goods or services, the Jobber must not charge a Hirer Service Fees on top of the agreed price for the goods or Services under the Job Contract.</p>
